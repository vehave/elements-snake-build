Chemical Elements - Snake is an engaging and educational chemistry learning game that allows players to practice the names and symbols of chemical elements in 40 different languages. This game is a creative twist on the classic Snake game, combining fun gameplay with valuable learning opportunities.

I recommend checking out another Snake-based chemistry learning game called Snakeleev, as well as the research indicating that it provides significant learning value after just ten minutes of use: Snakeleev: A Gamified Serious Game for Learning the Periodic Table. J. Chem. Educ., 2025, 102 (5), 1814â€“1828. <a>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.5c00029</a>. Available at: <a>https://github.com/PietroGalizia/Snakeleev</a>

## Game Description

In Chemical Elements - Snake, players navigate a snake on the game field, where four types of food correspond to the symbols of different chemical elements. At the top of the game screen, the name of a chemical element is displayed. The player's objective is to use the arrow keys to guide the snake towards the food that matches the displayed element's chemical symbol.

The game ends if the player collides with the wrong food or the edge of the game area, adding an element of challenge and excitement to the learning experience.
